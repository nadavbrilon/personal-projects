# PokeTaub
### Project Overview
PokeTaub is a simple Pokémon-like game implemented as a single-page application (SPA) using React. The game allows users to build a team of Pokémon and engage in battles against computer-controlled opponents.

### Features
Build and manage a team of Pokémon.
Participate in Pokémon battles against computer opponents.
View battle statistics and win/loss records.

### Installation
To install and run PokeTaub locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/poketaub.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd poketaub
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start

### Usage
Once the development server is running, you can access the PokeTaub application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the game and participate in battles.

### API Usage
PokeTaub utilizes the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data and images used in the game. This includes information such as Pokémon names, types, stats, and available moves. Asynchronous programming techniques are employed to fetch data from the API and update the game state accordingly.

### State Management
The PokeTaub project employs complex state management techniques, leveraging React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage component state and perform side effects. Careful consideration is given to minimize unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

### Credits
PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/): Provides Pokémon data and images used in the game.
React (https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
